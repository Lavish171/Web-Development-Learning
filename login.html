        <p><span>Generating random paragraphs</span> can be an excellent way for writers to 
            get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The 
            writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about
             when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to 
             complete one of three common writing challenges. The writer
              can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and
               build upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph
                somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is 
                to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short
                 story. No matter which of these
                  challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use
                   creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.</p>
